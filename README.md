In this implementation:

The shuffle_deck() function shuffles the deck.
deal_hand() deals a hand of 5 cards to each player.
print_hand() is a utility function to print a hand in a readable format.
evaluate_hand() evaluates the rank of a hand (e.g., Straight, Flush, etc.).
determine_winner() determines the winner based on the evaluated hand ranks.
play_poker() is the main function that initializes the game, deals hands to players, determines the winner, and prints the results.
You can modify the play_poker(num_players) function to change the number of players in the game. The current implementation plays a 5-player game.
